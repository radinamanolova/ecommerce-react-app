# ecommerce-react-app
The purpose of this demo project is to learn how to create a basic e-commerce solution. This is a React-based web application with an express server to handles stripe charges. To build this app I am using also react-redux, redux-saga, redux-thunk, styled-components, firebase for the user authentication, and stripe for handeling the payment function.

Main functionalities:
- home page with product categories
- category page with a list of products
- adding a product to the cart
- a cart preview modal
- checkout page with functionality to add more quantity of the product or to remove it 
- payment function integrated with Stripe(only test payment)
- authentication with email/password or Google account integrated with Firebase
